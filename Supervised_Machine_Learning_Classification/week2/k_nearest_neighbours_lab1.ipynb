    "In this lab, we will explore classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors approach. We will use a customer churn dataset from the telecom industry, which includes customer data such as long-distance usage, data usage, monthly revenue, types of offerings, and other services purchased by customers. The data, based on a fictional telecom firm, includes several Excel files which have been combined and are available in the course materials. We are using the subset of customers who have phone accounts. Since the data includes a mix of numeric, categorical, and ordinal variables, we will load this data and do some preprocessing. Then we will use K-nearest neighbors to predict customer churn rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this lab, you should have a working understanding of how to preprocess a variety of variables to apply the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, understand how to choose K, and understand how to evaluate model performance.\n"
