    "\n",
    "In this example from Reinforcement Learning, the task is to use tools from Machine Learning to predict how an agent should act. We will then use those predictions to drive the behavior of the agent. Ideally, our intelligent agent should get a much better score than a random agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observation**: These are the states of the game. It describes where the agent currently is.\n",
    "- **Action**: These are the moves that the agent makes.\n",
    "- **Episode**: One full game played from beginning (`env.reset()`) to end (when `done == True`).\n",
    "- **Step**: Part of a game that includes one action. The game transitions from one observation to the next.\n",
